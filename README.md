# Quantum-mining-puzzle-66
Currently setup to run on the IBM Quantum simulator 32 qubits simulation<br>
Same basic code to connect to live resources with some adjustments that will be needed<br>
Setup to match the first 4 characters of the Hash160<br>
Working on more selective 10 character version<br>
go to https://quantum.ibm.com/ and get an account so you can be assigned your personal API<br> 
Add your API code to quantum_login-step1.py<Br>
pip3 install qiskit<br>
pip3 install qiskit_ibm_provider<br>
pip3 install qiskit-ibm-runtime

If you go live you only get 10 minutes free after that IBM charges $1.60 US per minute<br>
Simulator has no time limit but really just tests the software for errors<br>
Since there is no real way to verify the software is completing the desired task on actual super computer<br>
If you decide to pay for time to IBM you are doing this at your own risk and I as the developer am not responsible<br>
for any loss(es) you may incur.
